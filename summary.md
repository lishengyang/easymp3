The Design of Mp3 Audio System in Medium of SD Card

[Abstract](Abstract.md) With widespread applications of technology in our digital life,data transporting between all kinds of consumable eletronic products is becoming more and more frequent.Meanwhile people abandom tapes,CD, VCD, and other traditional music medium,and updated home audio system with memory cards , flash disks, hard drive or online filesaving. Concerning the cost and convenience of updating content , the design of the MP3 playback audio system is based on the medium of sd cards.
> The purpose of this paper is to design a product which has excellent sound playback, and a low cost to build.The format of audio files is mp3, of which the popularity is very obvious for the internet music sharing,SD card is being read and written in the spi mode, which takes full advantage of the microcontroller`s bus architecture , MP3 decoding technology and fat file system, all of them can be used to build the entire mp3 player.
> The circuit structure is stated as follows:Using the 8-bit microcontrollers atmega8L as a controlling mcu , and vlsi company's mp3 decoder chip vs1003b, The mp3 files in the sd card is decoded and exported as an output signal,finally heard throuth an audio system. The experiment results show that this structure provides low loss technique and low power design.
> If adding more outstanding amplifier module whichincrease its output , this product can be transformed into a part of the family hifi audio,Or adding a wireless RF transmission functions, the functions of wireless audio, In every corner of the house people are able to access the music database , It can be also used in wireless digital broadcasting system.
